# DP-700 Microsoft Fabric Data Engineer Journey

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey through the 
**DP-700: Microsoft Fabric Data Engineer Associate** certification path.

## Skills Covered
- Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse Architecture
- Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold)
- Dataflows Gen2 (ETL Pipelines)
- Fabric Data Factory Orchestration
- Apache Spark (PySpark & Spark SQL)
- Delta Lake & External Tables Using Shortcuts
- Real-Time Data Analytics with Eventstreams & Eventhouse

## Objective
To build scalable, enterprise-grade **batch and real-time (streaming) data pipelines** 
using Microsoft Fabric and modern data engineering best practices.

## Tools & Technologies
- Microsoft Fabric
- Apache Spark
- Delta Lake
- Power Query Online
- KQL (Kusto Query Language)
- SQL Analytics Endpoint

## Hands-on Notes
### Lakehouse Setup Issue & Fix
- Issue: Could not create Lakehouse initially due to Fabric trial not being available.
- Fix: Disabled all workspace types in workspace settings, enabled Fabric trial, then Lakehouse creation succeeded.

### Completed Modules
- Lakehouse design and medallion architecture
- Dataflows Gen2 ingestion and transformations
- Orchestrating pipelines with Fabric Data Factory
- Large-scale data processing with Apache Spark
- Delta Lake tables with time travel, ACID transactions, and external tables using shortcuts
- Real-time analytics using Eventstreams and Eventhouse

## Screenshots of Completion Badges
